# judo footage analysis

This repository is work supporting _Semi-Supervised Extraction and Analysis of Judo Combat Phases from Recorded Live-Streamed Tournament Footage_.
The goal of the project is to automate live-stream recording segmentation into individual matches, extract combat phases from matches, and gather statistics at the tournament level.

This project was part of CS8813 Introduction to Research at Georgia Tech Europe during the Spring 2024 semester.
